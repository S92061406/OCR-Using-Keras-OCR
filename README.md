## Introduction

This OCR project utilizes Keras-OCR for text detection and recognition from images. The system is designed to analyze and extract text from billboard and road sign images.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Python (>= 3.8)

pip (Python package manager)

TensorFlow (>= 2.x)

Keras-OCR

Matplotlib (for visualization)

OpenCV (for image processing)

Pandas (for handling extracted text data)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/S92061406/OCR-Using-Keras-OCR.git

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

3. Install Dependencies

pip install tensorflow keras-ocr matplotlib opencv-python pandas

## Running the Project

1. Load and Process Images

Ensure your images are placed in a folder named images/. Update the script to point to this directory.

2. Run the OCR Script

python ocr_using_kerasocr.py

3. View Results

The extracted text and annotated images will be displayed, and results can be saved to a CSV file if needed.

Good luck with your OCR project!
